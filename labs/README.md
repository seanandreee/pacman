# CSE 140: Artificial Intelligence

Hello students!

This is the assignments repository for CSE 140: Artificial Intelligence.
This repo contains all the materials, resources, and links you will need to complete your assignments for this course.

## Setup

This course will be taught using Python (version >= 3.8).
If you are not familiar with Python,
you are not in trouble.
Although the purpose of this course is not to teach Python,
our assignments are not overly complex and there is enough slack for you to learn Python as you take this course.
(You will have to work a bit harder to do so.)
You can start learning with some of the [materials listed here](p0/README.md#python)

In addition to this repository,
you will be using our UCSC Pac-Man repository:
[github.com/linqs/pacman](https://github.com/linqs/pacman).
This contains all the core code we need for our Pac-Man-related AI agents,
as well as some stubs for you to use in your assignments.
You will want to make a **PRIVATE** copy of this repository in your GitHub account.
It must be **PRIVATE**
(if someone copies your code because your repo is public,
you are complicit in cheating).

Most of the setup materials for this course are listed in the
[first assignment's instructions](p0/README.md).
The key setup steps are:
1. Ensure Python (>= 3.8) is installed.
2. Setup your Python [virtual environment](p0/README.md#virtual-environments).
3. Install the requirements listed in this repository's [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.
4. Install [Tk](p0/README.md#tk).
5. Create a **private** copy of the [Pac-Man repo](https://github.com/linqs/pacman).
6. Clone your **private** Pac-Man repo.

## Assignments

These are five assignments for this course:
- [P0](p0/README.md)
- [P1](p1/README.md)
- [P2](p2/README.md)
- [P3](p3/README.md)
- [P4](p4/README.md)

P0 is a very simple assignment meant to give you a chance to get your development environment setup.
P4 is a super fun tournament!

## Autograder

We will be using an autograder to submit and grade your programming assignments in this course.
This allows you to get quick feedback on your assignments.
The autograder is [free and open source](https://github.com/edulinq/autograder-server),
so if you don't like it, you can make it better!
All instructions in our course documentation will be assuming that you are interacting with the autograder
via its [Python interface](https://github.com/edulinq/autograder-py),
which is listed as a dependency in this repository's [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

Basic instructions on using the autograder are covered in the
[first assignment's instructions](p0/README.md#submission),
but there are many features that you can explore that we do not discuss.
